### Overview
This directory is used for examples and practice of core data science principles. Everything in this directory is *from scratch* inspired by **Data Science from Scratch** (Joel Grus), **Mathematical Statistics with Resampling** (Chihara, Hesterberg), and **Probability and Computing** (Mitzenmacher, Upfal).

By *from scratch* I mean that the use of external packages and libraries are strictly limited to necessity. Personally, I believe that truly undertanding a subject unlocks a greater capacity to ask more meaningful and insightful questions.

#### Structure
This repo is broken down into subsections covering different topics of data science.
##### 1. Mathematics
- Probability & Statistics
